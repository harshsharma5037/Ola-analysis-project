2. Find the average ride distance per vehicle type  
3. Count total cancelled rides by customers  
4. Top 5 customers by ride volume  
5. Count driver cancellations (personal & car issues)  
6. Max & min driver ratings for Prime Sedan  
7. All UPI payment rides  
8. Average customer rating per vehicle type  
9. Total booking value for successful rides  
10. List of incomplete rides with reasons
